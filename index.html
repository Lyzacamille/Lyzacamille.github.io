<p> 
    My name is Lyza Camille Norton. I am from Indianapoils Indiana .
    In fact I am the <strong>only one</strong> in my family from Indianapoils, everyone else in my family is from Chicago.
    I  was born on December 7, 2001. So yes I am a sagittarius which is the best sign.
    I am the middle and smartest child at the age of 16. I am very determined and because of that some may say 
    that I am stubborn.
